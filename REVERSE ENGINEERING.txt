# Streaming Bluetooth traffic from Android device to laptop

You need to enable Developer Mode on the Android device and add adb on your local device.

Then run

```
adb shell settings put secure bluetooth_hci_snoop_enabled 1
```

The android device will ask to approve the connection. You might have to run this command twice.

Then in Wireshark look for  _Logcat Main_ interface.

Then filter on `writeCharacteristic`:

```
logcat_text.log contains "writeCharacteristic"
```
