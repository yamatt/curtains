```

### Turn curtains on and off

On:

```bash
rye run curtains on FF:44:10:22:75:68 49535343-8841-43f4-a8d4-ecbe34729bb3
```

Off:

```bash
rye run curtains off FF:44:10:22:75:68 49535343-8841-43f4-a8d4-ecbe34729bb3

rye run curtains preset FF:44:10:22:75:68 49535343-8841-43f4-a8d4-ecbe34729bb3 2 --brightness 0

Where `2` is the preset animation type from 1 to 109. And `--brightness` is brightness level from 0 (low brightness, but not off) to 255 (high brightness).
