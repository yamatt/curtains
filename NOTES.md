## 5833ff03-9b8b-5191-6142-22a4536ef123

Doesn't return anything in 60 seconds

## 49535343-1e4d-4bd9-ba61-23c647249616

Returns in 10 seconds:

- Before change: `\xaa\x04\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\xb2`
- After change: `\xaa\x04\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\xb2`

The values are identical

- First byte is likely a header
- Second byte is a type value
- Third byte is a length of the payload
- The next set of bytes in the length is the payload
- The last byte is a checksum of sum of all bytes modulo to 256

### Got some results when listening and pressing the button a few times:

- `\xaa\x04\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\xb2`
- `\xaa\x01\x08\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\x0b\x00d%`
- `\xaa\x01\x08\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\x0c\x00d&`
- `\xaa\x01\x08\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\r\x00d\`

## Turned them on and off

I wrote `\xaa\x02\x08\x00\x00\x00\x01\x02\x0d\x00\x64` plus checksum to `49535343-8841-43f4-a8d4-ecbe34729bb3` and this turned them off

- `\xaa\x02\x01\x01\x64` turned it back on
- `\xaa\x02\x01\x00\x64` turned it off

## Changing preset

Only the payload needs to be specified. The rest is generated by the packet object.

`\x03` is the preset type

- `0201030d`
- `0201030c`

### Preset Types

First byte of the payload is preset type.

#### Solid colour

This 00 and 01 for solid colour. I can't seem to change the colour.
`030701...` is solid colours

`00F003E803` changed colour to blue-ish
`000003E803` changed colour to red
`0166019B03` changed color to pink
`0000000003` changed to white
`007803E803` changed color to green
`001203BC03` changed color to orange-ish

the last `3` is a brightness level from 0 to F.

#### Animations

When the first byte is `02` you can select animations

Second byte sets the type of animation.

If the second byte is `00` it pauses the animation.

The second byte can be any number. There are 109 animations from 01 to 6e.

The third byte is a brightness value from `00` to `ff`. `00` isn't off, but low. `ff` is full brightness.

`03...` is manual control

`0309...` is music

`0304...` is preset animation

The fourth byte appears to control animation speed from `00` (slow) to `ff` (fast). Examples in the payload section show 4-byte payloads like `0201030d` where the last byte (0d) is the speed parameter.

`03...` is manual control

`0309...` is music

`0304...` is preset animation
